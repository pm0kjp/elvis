Elvis

This is a console program inspired by the King, who would watch
multiple televisions on a single wall, long before we were all
multi-screen users.

I use this code as a console to take a quick peek at all of my
major clients' sites, to ensure that everything looks good, at
least at first glance.

This code depends on iframes, and some websites set their headers
to discourage or prevent iframe use.  I do not include code here
to break that lock, although code snippets are out there.

Enjoy.
